# Time-series-with-CNNs
In this code, we'll see what convolution looks like on a time-series.

Convolutional networks turn out to be useful not only (two-dimensional) images, but also on things like time-series (one-dimensional) and video (three-dimensional).

We've seen many times how convolutional networks can learn to extract features from (two-dimensional) images. It turns out that convnets can also learn to extract features from things like time-series (one-dimensional) and video (three-dimensional).

Here, we'll see what convolution looks like on a time-series.

The time series we'll use is from Google Trends. It measures the popularity of the search term "machine learning" for weeks from January 25, 2015 to January 15, 2020.
